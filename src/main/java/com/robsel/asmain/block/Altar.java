    to activate the altar one must not just sacrifice all manner of living things, but their own body.
    to avoid dying in hardcore mode, soul jar is created. deposit ur soul in the jar, and watch yourself walk away as your vision is bound to the jar, but faint visions, feelings, sounds of your body you are linked with still impart upon thy conscience
    -sounds only from body location
    -messages "i feel stone under my feet" i am punching this very specific altar block "i can feel this is the right position to start the ritual"
    -faded vision of body overlain on screen/part of jar wall, gets less poignant with distance
    -sick transformation animation
    -$overtake villager$
