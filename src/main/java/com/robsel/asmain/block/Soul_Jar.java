    /*
     deposit ur soul in the jar, and watch yourself walk away as your vision is bound to the jar, but faint visions, feelings, sounds of your body you are linked with still impart upon thy conscience
    -sounds only from body location
    -messages "i feel stone under my feet" i am punching this very specific altar block "i can feel this is the right position to start the ritual"
    -faded vision of body overlain on screen/part of jar wall, gets less poignant with distance
    -sick transformation animation
    -$overtake villager$(any entity? bind other entity to soul: while in jar, entity that is not last body right click soul jar to swap. able to release soul by breaking jar and holding right click(violent shake and entity sound
                           fades into silence)
    -cool visuals if in inventory? see other items in darkness unless open(how toolbelt?), be carried in hand or offhand or on head
    -360Â° vision, but jar cages
