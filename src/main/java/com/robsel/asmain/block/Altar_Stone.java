    tentacles pull any entity inside
    another blood toll must be paid
    when paid, tentacles turn into two eyes
    eyes seek pedestal, when found other side dissapears, if pedestal dissapears, portal closes
    any item right clicked onto pedestal is sucked into eye, where pupil turns into void vortex
    unless below items or music disc(get custom music disc), spit congealed cthulu out
    if below items given, eye turns ravenous, goes back to normal if any other item in between -> congealed cthulu out and has to start over
    2 diamond , 3 netherite ingot, netherstar, gold block, filled soul jar(how make sword of self? like advtime)
    if successful, portal dissapears (with laughter?), explodes violently and leaves behind the Apocalyptic Spineripper
